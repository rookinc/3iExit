title: "3iExit: Sun–Earth–3I Minimal-Area Coupling Analysis Framework"
abstract: >
  Preregistered, falsifiable workflow for testing heliospheric amplification
  signatures gated by Sun–Earth–3I minimal-area geometry and moderate–high
  solar-wind forcing. Includes scripts for geometry windows, spectral slope
  estimation, closure residual surrogate, and pass/fail criteria.
